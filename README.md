# Supermarket System

This is a supermarket system in which you can "buy" and add or remove producs.

## Overview

The user can choose one of seven categories and add products to the cart. They must also define the amount of the product they want to buy. Above the list is a searchbox where the user can search for a specific product. Users can remove one product form the cart at a time or they can emty the whole cart. Buying items simply shows a message that the bill has been payed. It is possible to add a product by defining a category, a name and a price for it. It's also possible to see all prevous purchases but that window will automatically close after a certain period.

All product data is being stored in a Microsoft Access Database.
